# Text Files

When you upload a file ending in `.txt` or `.text`, Portal provides a variety of ways in which you can transform your data.

## Text Stats

For example, when applying our "Text Stats" option to JFK's inaugural address, **Portal** returns the following result:

```
{
	"flesch_reading_ease": 38.05,
	"smog_index": 15,
	"flesch_kincaid_grade": 20.3,
	"coleman_liau_index": 9.88,
	"automated_readability_index": 25.3,
	"dale_chall_readability_score": 8.42,
	"difficult_words": 197,
	"linsear_write_formula": 10.833333333333334,
	"gunning_fog": 21.99,
	"word_count": 1314,
	"unique_words": 617
}
```

This result is saved as a `.json` file in your private storage area.

## BERT Vectors

For more advanced NLP, try the **Generate BERT Vectors** option which can help convert your text data into BERT vectors.
