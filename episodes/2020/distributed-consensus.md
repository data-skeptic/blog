## Distributed Consensus

Computer Science research fellow of Cambridge University, [Heidi Howard](https://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/) discusses Paxos, Raft, and distributed consensus in distributed systems alongside with her work [Paxos vs. Raft: Have we reached consensus on distributed consensus?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05074)

She goes into detail about the leaders in Paxos and Raft and how The Raft Consensus Algorithm actually inspired her to pursue her PhD.
