## Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is a desirable property in a distributed computing environment.  BFT means the system can survive the loss of nodes and nodes becoming unreliable.  There are many different protocols for achieving BFT, though not all options can scale to large network sizes.

[Ted Yin](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tedyin/) joins us to explain BFT, survey the wide variety of protocols, and share details about [HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069).
