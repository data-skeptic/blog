[Jessica Hullman](https://twitter.com/jessicahullman?lang=en) joins us to share her expertise on data visualization and communication of data in the media.  We discuss Jessica's work on visualizing uncertainty, interviewing visualization designers on why they don't visualize uncertainty, and modeling interactions with visualizations as Bayesian updates.
