## GANs Can Be Interpretable

[Erik Härkönen](https://twitter.com/ekiharkonen) joins us to discuss the paper [GANSpace: Discovering Interpretable GAN Controls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02546).  During the interview, Kyle makes reference to this amazing [interpretable GAN controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdTICDa_eAI&feature=youtu.be) video and it's accompanying codebase found [here](https://github.com/harskish/ganspace).  Erik mentions the [GANspace collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g-ShMzkRWDMHPyjom_p-5kqkn2f-GwBi) which is a rapid way to try these ideas out for yourself.
