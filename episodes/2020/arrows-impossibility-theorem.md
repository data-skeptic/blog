## Arrow's Impossibility Theorem

Above all everyone wants voting to be fair.  What does fair mean and how can we measure it?  Kenneth Arrow posited a simple set of conditions that one would certainly desire in a voting system.  For example, unanimity - if everyone picks candidate A, then A should win!

Yet surprisingly, under a few basic assumptions, this theorem demonstrates that no voting system exists which can satisfy all the criteria.

This episode is a discussion about the structure of the proof and some of it's implications.
