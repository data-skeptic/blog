## They're Coming for Our Jobs

AI has, is, and will continue to facilitate the automation of work done by humans.  Sometimes this may be an entire role.  Other times it may automate a particular part of their role, scaling their effectiveness.  Unless progress in AI inexplicably halts, the tasks done by humans vs. machines will continue to evolve.  Today's episode is a speculative conversation about what the future may hold.

Co-Host of [Squaring the Strange Podcast](https://squaringthestrange.wordpress.com/), Caricature Artist, and an Academic Editor, [Celestia Ward](https://twitter.com/celestiaward) joins us today! Kyle and Celestia discuss whether or not her jobs as a caricature artist or as an academic editor are under threat from AI automation.
