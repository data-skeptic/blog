[Angus Dempster](https://github.com/angus924), PhD Student at Monash University in Australia, comes on today to talk about [MINIROCKET: A Very Fast (Almost) Deterministic Transform for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08791), a fast deterministic transform for time series classification.  MINIROCKET reformulates ROCKET, gaining a 75x improvement on larger datasets with essentially the same performance.  In this episode, we talk about the insights that realized this speedup as well as use cases.
