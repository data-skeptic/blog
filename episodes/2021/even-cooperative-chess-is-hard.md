## Even Cooperative Chess is Hard

Asside from victory questions like "can black force a checkmate on white in 5 moves?" many novel questions can be asked about a game of chess.  Some questions are trivial (e.g. "How many pieces does white have?") while more computationally challenging questions can contribute interesting results in computational complexity theory.

In this episode, Josh Brunner joins us to discuss his recent paper [Complexity of Retrograde and Helpmate Chess Problems: Even Cooperative Chess is Hard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09271).
