## Opportunities for Skillful Weather Prediction

Today on the show we have [Elizabeth Barnes](https://twitter.com/atmosbarnes), Associate Professor in the department of [Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University](https://twitter.com/CSUAtmosSci), who joins us to talk about her work [Identifying Opportunities for Skillful Weather Prediction with Interpretable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07830).

Weather is notoriously difficult to predict.  Complex systems are demanding of computational power.  Further, the chaotic nature of, well, nature, makes accurate forecasting especially difficult the longer into the future one wants to look.  Yet all is not lost!

In this interview, we explore the use of machine learning to help identify certain conditions under which the weather system has entered an unusually predictable position in it's normally chaotic state space.
