## Orders of Magnitude

Today's show in two parts.  First, Linhda joins us to review the episodes from Data Skeptic: Pilot Season and give her feedback on each of the topics.

Second, we introduce our new segment "Orders of Magnitude".  It's a statistical game show in which participants must identify the true statistic hidden in a list of statistics which are off by at least an order of magnitude.  Below are the sources of our questions.
