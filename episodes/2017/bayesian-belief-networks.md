## Bayesian Belief Networks

A Bayesian Belief Network is an acyclic directed graph composed of nodes that represent random variables and edges that imply a conditional dependence between them.  It's an intuitive way of encoding your statistical knowledge about a system and is efficient to propogate belief updates throughout the network when new information is added.
