# Why Machines will never Rule the World

On the show today, we are joined by Barry Smith and Jobst Landgrebe, authors of the book “Why Machines will never Rule the World.” Barry teaches at the University of Buffalo and is a visiting professor at the University of Italian Switzerland. Jobst is the Managing director at Cognotekt, an AI company based in Germany.

Barry started by giving a background on the need for the book. At the core, it stems from people being scared about the exponential growth of AI possibilities. Jobst shared his stance on whether AI systems are truly intelligent. Barry further discussed how AI systems are an extension of mathematical theories and thus have limitations. They both discussed how the will and the desire of humans inherently make humans more complex than machines can ever be.

Going forward, Jobst defined what intelligence is. He also discussed why machines can not provide solutions to novel problems. They both also gave reasons why machines cannot excellently engage in dialogues.
