# Agents with Theory of Mind Play Hanabi

Nieves Montes, a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, joins us. Her PhD research revolves around value-based reasoning in relation to norms. She shares her latest study, [Combining theory of mind and abductive reasoning in agent‑oriented programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s10458-023-09613-w#:~:text=By%20combining%20the%20previous%20capability,to%20their%20own%20decision%2Dmaking.)

Nieves gave an introduction to what multiagent systems are and how they fit into other machine-learning applications. She also explained how societal values are quantified and applied in agent-based multi-agent research.  

Nieves then defined theory of mind (ToM), abduction reasoning, and the difference between concepts. Nieves discussed how she built her symbolic-based AI model, TomAbd, that grasped ToM and abductive reasoning. She spoke about the Hanabi game for evaluating her model’s ability.

Nieves explained the theoretical components required to build the TomAbd agent model to play the Hanabi game. She also discussed the metrics to evaluate the agents' performance in learning with ToM and abduction reasoning. 

Nieves shared the computation price and the scalability challenges that come with using TomAbd. She, however, also shared the benefits of TomAbd agent models over native deep learning models in certain applications.
