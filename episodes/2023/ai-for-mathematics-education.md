# AI for Mathematics Education

On today's show, Steven Van Vaerenbergh joins us. Stephen works in the Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, and his research lies in artificial intelligence and mathematics education.

Steven started by discussing how AI is being used for mathematics education. He cited products such as [Photomath](https://photomath.com/en), which uses AI to solve mathematical problems from a picture. He discussed how he and his colleagues investigated the inner workings of such AI systems to classify the algorithms used. 

Steven shared his thoughts on the prospects of advanced AI technologies for online learning. He discussed the hallucination problem with LLMs such as ChatGPT. He also discussed how [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/), a computation intelligence tool, is used to augment ChatGPT performance for mathematical problems.

Steven his thoughts on the possibility of using AI tools as a personalized math tutor. He also discussed the strengths and weaknesses of such AI models. Winding down, he shared some ideas for his future research. You can follow Steven on Twitter [@steven2358](https://twitter.com/steven2358?lang=en) to learn more.
