# AI Fails on Theory of Mind Tasks

On the show today, we are joined by Tomer Ullman, an assistant professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He is a cognitive scientist with research in cognitive modeling and development.

Tomer started by sharing the intersection between psychology and AI. He shared his thoughts on whether AI models can be developed without knowledge and learn as they experience the world. Tomer gave a rich explanation of the theory of mind and whether machines now possess the property.  He explained how the [Sally-Anne test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test) measures a machine’s level of the theory of mind.

He also shared his thoughts about animals having the theory of mind. He discussed the evolution of published datasets to evaluate machines for the theory of mind test. Tomer shared how he conducted his experiment that shows LLMs fail the theory of mind tests, a [study he published](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08399). He explained the [Smarties tube test](https://edinburgh-lothian-mobile-speech-therapy.co.uk/autism/the-smarties-tube-test-of-theory-of-mind) — another test for theory of mind. He also discussed how he made variations of the Sally-Anne test and the Smarties tube test on GPT 3.5 to test for the theory of mind.

Tomer shared his views on developing more advanced tests for the theory of mind in machines. To learn more about Tomer’s work, follow him on Twitter [@TomerUllman](https://twitter.com/TomerUllman) or check his [website](http://www.tomerullman.org/).
