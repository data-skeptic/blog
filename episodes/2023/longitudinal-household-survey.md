Noura shared the findings from their data exploration. She focused on the trends and observations in food insecurity. She explained what food insecurity was and the levels of food insecurity. She shared the percentage of people living with food insecurity and the observed trends over the years. She also shared the demography of those prone to food insecurity and its impact on their lives.

Rounding off, Noura discussed how the findings from their studies can help shape governmental policies. She emphasized transparency in their data cleaning process.
