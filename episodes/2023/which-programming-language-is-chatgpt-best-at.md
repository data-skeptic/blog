# Which Programming Language is ChatGPT Best at?

In this episode, we have Alessio Buscemi, a software engineer at Lifeware SA. Alessio was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg. He joins us to discuss his paper, [A Comparative Study of Code Generation using ChatGPT 3.5 across 10 Programming Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04477).

Alessio shared his thoughts on whether ChatGPT is a threat to software engineers. He discussed how LLMs can help software engineers become more efficient.

Delving into his study, he discussed how he set up his experiment and the kind of tasks he fed into ChatGPT. He discussed his results, particularly the programming languages ChatGPT performed the best on, as well as the domains it does better on. He also shared factors that affect the performance of ChatGPT in coding tasks.

Alessio shared some of his future research ideas. To learn more about Alessioâ€™s work, follow him on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessio-buscemi-962636114/).
