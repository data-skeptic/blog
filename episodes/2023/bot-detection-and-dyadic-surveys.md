# Bot Detection and Dyadic Surveys

Sara Bybee, a postdoctoral research scholar at the University of Utah, joins us today. Her research focuses on social screening and community outreach interventions. On the show, she shares her study which involved detecting social bots in surveys.

Sara's study was aimed at understanding LGBTQ couples facing cancer. She began by discussing why using quantitative and qualitative data was critical for her study. She highlighted the importance of using narratives to capture deeper insights from respondents. She then shared the process for her research, starting from sending the initial interest form to potential respondents. She shared a red flag she observed after receiving the submitted form. She speculated that some of the responses were from bots. Sara shared her strategy for validating her suspicion and authenticating the submissions.

Going forward, Sara detailed how to avoid receiving bots-filled surveys. She also shared the eligibility criteria she used that help filter genuine responses. She discussed important considerations for researchers when conducting a survey. She also advised engaging the services of companies that offer verified online participants.

Sara spoke about the challenge of not having underrepresented communities fill out survey forms. She then discussed how they can be more represented. Rounding up, she shared some insights about her study on LGBTQ couples facing cancer. She touched on some nuances between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ couples.
