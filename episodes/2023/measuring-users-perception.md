# Measuring User’s Perception

Today, Mariah Schrum and Matthew Gombolay join us. Maria is a Ph.D. student in the CORE Robotics Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology. Matthew is an Assistant Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. He is also the Director of the CORE Robotics Lab. They discuss best practices for measuring a respondent’s perception in a survey.

Matthew began by giving some insight into the kind of work done at his laboratory. Putting it simply, they build robots with a core focus on their interaction with humans. Matthew explained how robots differ from LLMs such as ChatGPT. He also discussed how robots' performance can be measured. It was more complicated than conventional machine learning models. Mariah spoke about the Likert scale, a metric to measure respondents’ attitudes. 

Mariah extensively discussed how researchers and HR practitioners can use the scale to measure one’s perception of a robot. She also discussed the recent problems of employing different scales that are not thoroughly validated.

Matthew discussed the process of validation, starting with measuring humans' trust in robots. Mariah then outlined some best practices when developing good scales. She also shared some of the dangers of not following these best practices. She explained how researchers can convert complex distributional data from the survey to tangible insights using the Likert scale. They both discussed techniques to help check the quality of responses on a survey.

They also shared some common mistakes they found in research paper surveys. Rounding up, Matthew discussed the trends of robot adoption for the coming years and some new research they are working on.
