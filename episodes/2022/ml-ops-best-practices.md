# MLOps Best Practices

Today, we are joined by Piotr Niedźwiedź, Founder and CEO of [Neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/).  Neptune.ai is a powerful tool for tracking and managing machine learning models. Piotr discusses common MLOps activities and how data science teams can take advantage of Neptune.ai for better experiment tracking.

Piotr started with a background about his life and how he got into coding and machine learning. He then gave some insight into how the average user of Neptune.ai uses the platform. He also mentioned when beginners are advised to start using machine learning tools. 

Piotr also gave some advice on key activities that should be done by machine learning specialists during machine learning development. They include logging the evolution of your training metrics, the data used, hyperparameters tuning, etc. Furthermore, Piotr compared and contrasted the logging activities in a data science role and a software development role. 

Speaking of teamwork, Piotr discussed the collaboration potential for teams using ML tools such as Neptune.ai. He also explained how Neptune.ai is not only useful for collaboration in a team but in the entire organization.

Piotr then spoke about the place of Neptune.ai in the ML tech stack ecosystem. He mentioned the typical users of Neptune.ai and the growth trajectory of experiment tracking as a typical ML operation. He then talked about the short-term and long-term benefits of experiment tracking and model registry for machine learning developers. 

You can read more about how to use the Neptune.ai platform from their [blog page](https://neptune.ai/blog) or learn more about the platform from their [documentation](https://docs.neptune.ai/).
