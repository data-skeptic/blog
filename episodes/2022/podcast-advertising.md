# Podcast Advertising

Today, we are joined by Rob Walch, the VP of Podcast Relations at Libsyn. Libsyn is a popular podcast hosting platform, where the Data Skeptic podcast is hosted. Rob tells us about podcast advertising on the show.

Rob began with what a podcast is and the place of podcast hosting services. He then explained why everyone should have their podcast on Apple Podcast. He also touched on situations where people try to boost their analytics by hiring companies to listen to their podcasts over and over. Rob outlined strategies Libsyn uses to identify such spammy listens.

He then explained how podcasters can monetize their podcasts using Host Red. He also gave some advice on how to increase the number of podcast downloads in a month. In addition, he spoke about the complexities of podcast advertising and the regulations that protect listenersâ€™ data.

Rob then discusses how to engage the podcast audience using surveys. He explained the benefits of surveys in getting a realistic number of engaging listeners. Further to that, he discussed the growth trajectory in the podcasting space and the prospects for the future. He also explained why iOS users have 5 times more podcast listeners than Android users even though there are 5X more Android phones than iPhones.

Rounding up, he spoke about different ways to monetize your podcast beyond getting sponsors. You can reach out to Rob by [email](mailto:rob@libsyn.com) or follow him on Twitter [@podcast411](https://twitter.com/podcast411).
