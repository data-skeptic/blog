## k-means Image Segmentation

Linh Da joins us to discuss how image segmentation can be done using k-means clustering. Image segmentation involves dividing an image into a distinct set of segments. One such approach is to do this purely on color, in which case, k-means clustering can get the job done.

In the image below, you can see the k-means clustering segmentation results for the same image with the values of 2, 4, 6, and 8 for k.
