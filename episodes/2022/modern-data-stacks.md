# Modern Data Stacks
Today, we are joined by Alexander Thor, a Product Manager at Vizlib, makers of Astrato. Astrato is a data analytics and business intelligence tool built on the cloud and for the cloud. Alexander discusses the features and capabilities of Astrato for data professionals.

Alexander explained what analytics is and how the career has evolved over the years. He also discussed how important analytics is in this age. Having established the importance of a smooth data engineering experience, Alexander discussed the major problem Astrato solves in the face of other similar analytics tools such as Snowflake. He explained why in-memory is not used in Astrato, despite it being a great option some years back. 

Going forward, Alexander explained the difference between a dashboard and a data app. Putting it simply, data apps are applications that rely heavily on data. Yelp is a typical example. Alexander then went into some real scenarios where Astrato comes in handy. He also spoke on the collaboration features on the platform. 

Alexander described the typical persona of an Astrato user - the requisite skill and level of experience. With technological innovations and continuous development, the Product Manager explained how having data in the data warehouse is the best way to build systems robust to changes. Furthermore, he gave an insight into how businesses can best structure their organization to get the optimum insights from data.  For a beginner who is yet to master the intricacies of dashboarding, Alexander explained techniques they can deploy to generate quick insights. He also mentioned some tips to create powerful dashboards.
