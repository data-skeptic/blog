# Remote Learning in Applied Engineering
Today, Mouhamed Abdulla joins us to speak about remote learning in applied engineering. Mouhamed is a professor of Electrical Engineering at Sheridan Institute of Technology.

He began with an insight into how he taught engineering courses before and how he is teaching now. Before the pandemic, he and his colleagues scarcely used online learning tools but had to learn to teach with learning management tools after the pandemic. 

The professor spoke about the challenges he faced with the new style of teaching. He explained how it was difficult for international students to get the necessary equipment for the online lab sessions. Also, he talked about the challenge with purchasing more expensive equipment and how he had to restructure the labs from scratch to fit the new reality. He further discussed the key takeaways from the entire experience.

Mouhamed then delved deeper into his paper, [Remote Teaching and Learning in Applied Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02714), where he indicated the impact of the different waves of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada on higher education. He discussed how he and the students went through those periods of uncertainties in the classroom. In addition, he highlighted the bottlenecks in evaluating the effectiveness of the online classes as students were reluctant to participate in online classroom activities. Mouhamed explained the present state of things in the classroom after over two years since the pandemic. He also talked about the projections for a hybrid learning post-COVID. 

Mouhamed touched on how he and his colleagues have managed to deal with a major challenge with online learning - plagiarism. He explained how plagiarism checkers such as Turnitin were not enough to establish the integrity of a student’s assignment submission. Meanwhile, speaking of the positives of remote teaching, he revealed how the pandemic opened up the possibilities for an effective yet cheaper alternative to labs. 

Finally, he spoke about a book recently published by Springer Nature he co-authored with other international contributors on teaching and learning. The book discusses how different countries approached teaching during the pandemic and the future of education. The preprint of the book chapter is freely available on [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr380253) (which is used by [WHO](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/pt/ppcovidwho-291114?lang=en)) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02714).
