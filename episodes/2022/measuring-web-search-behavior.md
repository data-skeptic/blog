# Measuring Web Search Behavior

Itâ€™s a double guest show today. Aleksandra Urman and Mykola Makhortykh join us to discuss their work on the [comparative analysis of web search behavior using web tracking data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04961). Aleksandra is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, Switzerland where she works with s social computing group. Mykola, on the other hand, is a lecturer at the University of Bern working at the Institute of Media and Communication Studies in Bern.

Aleksandra started with how they both began with the project, specifically in collecting data. Mykola detailed the activities involved in tracking browsing data from German and Swiss citizens. He also discussed how he ensured transparency and privacy sensitivity in the data collection process. In addition, he discussed the research questions used for the analysis.

Aleksandra stated how their analysis differs from other similar research. She spoke in terms of the newness, originality, and specificity of the data. 

She then shed light on the intriguing discovery from their analysis. One such discovery was that women search less on the weekend compared to men. They both hypothesize on the plausible reason for this observation.

Aleksandra revealed how German and Swiss citizens use search engines such as Google, Bing, Ecosia, etc. Furthermore, Mykola and Aleksandra discussed some of the takeaways for search engines from the analysis result. Rounding up, they revealed other research topics in the works.
