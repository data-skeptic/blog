## ML Ops in Production

Moses Guttman from [Clear ML](https://clear.ml/) joins us to share insights about how organizations leveraging machine learning keep their programs on track.  While 
many parallels exist between the software development life cycle (SWLC) and the machine learning development life cycle, successful deployments of ML in production 
have demonstrated that a unique set of tools is required.  Moses and I discuss the emergence of ML Ops, success stories, and how modern teams leverage tools like 
Clear ML's open source solution to maximize the value of ML in the organization.
