# Affiliate Marketing Rabbithole

On the show today, we are joined by Brian Dunning, the host of the [Skeptoid podcast](https://skeptoid.com/). Skeptoid podcast is a weekly podcast focused on conversations around skepticism and pseudoscience. Today, Brian shares his personal story about affiliate marketing and the civil case he had with eBay between 2008 and 2014.

Brian began with a background about himself and how he started podcasting in 2006. He then got into affiliate marketing. Brian explained how affiliate marketing works in simple terms, and how people make money off it. He talked about his time of work with Commission Junction and eBay. At the time, he built widgets — WhoLinked and Profile Maps — to increase the reach of affiliate links. 

Brian discussed the conflict of interest between eBay and Commission Junction at the time and his being at the center of it. He also talked about the civil case with eBay and how he eventually used the [Nuisance Settlement](https://www.upcounsel.com/nuisance-fee-settlement#:~:text=Nuisance%20Fee%20Settlement-,A%20nuisance%20fee%20settlement%2C%20or%20nuisance%20value%20settlement%2C%20is%20a,the%20claim%20in%20the%20courts.) to conclude the case.
