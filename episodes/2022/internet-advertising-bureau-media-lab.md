# Internet Advertising Bureau Media Lab

Today, we are joined by Anthony Katsur, the CEO of IAB Tech Lab. The IAB Tech Lab is the global technical standard-setting body for digital advertising. Anthony joins us to discuss the standards within the ad tech industry and what IAB Tech Lab does in that space.

Anthony began by explaining how IAB standards are developed. He elaborated on the process involved in spreading standards across the industry. He also discussed what it requires to be compliant with those standards using the [RTB protocol](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/). He explained the roles of working groups in developing and propagating new standards in the industry. 

Anthony talked about cases of controversy within the RTB protocol and how they address it. He belabored in finding a balance between consumer privacy and data security. He also talked about the penalty for not adhering to local and global standards. With the increase in privacy regulations, he explains how it gets difficult for businesses to keep up with new privacy laws.

Anthony then discussed what IAB Tech Lab does to ensure businesses adhere to standards. He explained some solutions IAB Tech Lab is currently working on for more privacy-centric ads. Solutions such as secure multiparty compute, differential privacy, and on-device compute were highlighted. He also had his opinion on whether advertising will be phased-out in the coming years. 

Anthony spoke about Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) standard. He spoke about the trends in the digital ad space and where the technology is poised to be in years to come. He particularly spoke about connected TVs (CTVs) and how targeted ads can be done with the technology.
