This season it’s become clear that computing skills are vital for working in the natural sciences. In this episode, we were fortunate to speak with 
Madlen Wilmes, co-author of the book [Computing Skills for Biologists: A Toolbox](https://www.amazon.com/Computing-Skills-Biologists-Stefano-Allesina/dp/0691182752). We discussed the book and why it’s a great resource for 
students and teachers. In addition to the book, Madlen shared her experience and advice on transitioning from academia to an industry career and how data analytic 
skills transfer to jobs that your professionals might not always consider. Join us and learn more about the book and careers using transferable skills.
