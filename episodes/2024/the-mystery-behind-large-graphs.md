# The mystery behind large graphs

Our guest in this episode is David Tench, a Grace Hopper postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, who specializes in scalable graph algorithms and compression techniques to tackle massive datasets.

In this episode, we will learn how his techniques enable real-time analysis of large datasets, such as particle tracking in physics experiments or social network analysis, by reducing storage requirements while preserving critical structural properties.

David also challenges the common belief that giant graphs are sparse by pointing to a potential bias: Maybe because of the challenges that exist in analyzing large dense graphs, we only see datasets of sparse graphs? The truth is out thereâ€¦

David encourages you to reach out to him if you have a large scale graph application that you don't currently have the capacity to deal with using your current methods and your current hardware. He promises to "look for the hammer that might help you with your nail".
