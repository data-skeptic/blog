# Openworm
On this episode, we are joined by Stephen Larson, the CEO of MetaCell and an affiliate of the OpenWorm foundation. Stephen discussed what the Openworm project is about. They hope to use a digital _C. elegans nematode_ (_C. elegans_ for short) to study the basics of life.

Stephen discussed why _C. elegans_ is an ideal organism for studying life in the lab. He also discussed the steps involved in simulating a digital organism. He mentioned the constraints on the cellular scale that informed their development of a digital _C. elegans_.

Stephen discussed the validation process of the simulation. He discussed how they discovered the best parameters to capture the behavior of natural _C. elegans_. He also discussed how biologists embraced the project.

Stephen discussed the computational requirements for improving the simulation parameters of the model and the kind of data they require to scale up. Stephen discussed some findings that the machine-learning communities can take away from the project. He also mentioned how students can get involved in the Openworm project. Rounding up, he shared future plans for the project.
