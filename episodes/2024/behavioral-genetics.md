# Behavioral Genetics

Our guest today is Jessica Hekman, the President of Functional Dog Collaborative and a teacher of behavioral biology at Virginia Tech. She joins us to discuss her work on behavioral genetics, particularly in dogs.

Jessica gave background information about what the Functional Dog Collaborative does. Jessica discussed how dog breeders can breed dogs with reduced risks of undesirable traits or diseases. She also discussed how genes that cause diseases can be detected and mentioned the possibility of changing some undesirable genes. 

Jessica discussed the extent to which genetics affects behavior. She also discussed how she and her coauthors got data to understand breed behaviors that are scientific or based on our perception.

Jessica also discussed how they can measure how much a dog demonstrates its breed ancestry. She discussed how she and her coauthors perform experiments to understand the genetic or environmental influence on a dogâ€™s behavior. She discussed future research ideas in the field.
