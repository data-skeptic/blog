# Reducing the Impact of Ship Noise on Marine Mammals

Today's guest is Akash Venkateshwaran, a graduate student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. His research is centered on developing technologies to mitigate anthropogenic noise, specifically in marine activities. He joins us to discuss his paper on the impact of reducing ship noise on marine mammals.

Akash discussed why anthropogenic noise is first a problem. He mentioned how mammals react to ship noises, and researchers measure this impact. He also discussed the sources of noise from the vessel. He discussed how reducing noise can help ship owners reduce fuel consumption and carbon footprint.

Akash discussed how he determined the most optimized objective parameters. He also talked about the algorithm he used to optimize the objective functions and why it was a good choice. He discussed how he performed this optimization. Akash discussed how he validated his method.
