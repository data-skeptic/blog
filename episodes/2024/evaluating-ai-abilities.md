# Evaluating AI Abilities 

Our guest today is Konstantinos (Kozzy) Voudouris, a post-doctoral researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge. His research focuses on unifying artificial and natural intelligence, specifically in understanding how the common sense capabilities of animals are determined.

Kozzy discussed some of the latent capabilities in animals that are being studied. He focused on common sense capabilities such as object permanence. He used object permanence abilities as an example. He discussed the evolution cognition project and the major transitions that are key in the evolution of cognitive systems. He also addressed the overlap between AI and psychology.

Kozzy discussed animal AI. He explained how the trap tube test was used to understand animalâ€™s causality in their world. He also discussed how he set up such experiments using reinforcement learning. He shared the deep learning and reinforcement learning libraries he used. 

Kozzy also talked about the animal AI Olympics. Kozzy gave his thoughts on the trajectory of reinforcement learning and possibilities for more capabilities in the field. He also shared what was next for the project.
