# Networks for AB testing

In this episode, the data scientist Wentao Su shares his experience in AB testing on social media platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok.

We talk about how network science can enhance AB testing by accounting for complex social interactions, especially in environments where users are both viewers and content creators. These interactions might cause a "spillover effect" meaning a possible influence across experimental groups, which can distort results.

To mitigate this effect, our guest presents heuristics and algorithms they developed ("one-degree label propagation‚Äù) to allow for good results on big data with minimal running time and so optimize user experience and advertiser performance in social media platforms.
