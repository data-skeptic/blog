# Bird Distribution Modeling with SatBird

We are joined by Mélisande Teng, a PhD candidate at Université de Montréal. Her research lies in the intersection of remote sensing and computer vision for biodiversity monitoring. 

She discussed what remote sensing is. She shared some of the uses of satellite data and some metadata that they contain. The data could include latitude and longitude which can be encoded in a certain way to respect the geometry of the earth. 

Mélisande talked about the SatBird project. The idea was to improve the prediction of species distribution models by integrating satellite imagery and environmental data. She discussed the what the SatBird dataset consists of. She also discussed some key observations about the data. She discussed the process of training the model. She share the training approaches that were most useful in her work. She also discussed some technical decisions that potentially made their model better.

Mélisande talked about the benefits of SatBird to ecologists and the machine learning community. She also talked about the advantages of using SatBird over traditional modelling techniques. She rounded up talking about her future projects.
