# Bioinspired Engineering

In today’s episode, we are joined by Brian Taylor, an Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. His research revolves around bioinspired navigation and orientation. He joins us to discuss his work on [Bioinspired magnetoreception and navigation using magnetic signatures as waypoints](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/aabbec).

Brian discussed the different ways animals sense and navigate the world around them. He discussed how animals use Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld for long-distance migration. He shared how this approach compares to conventional GPS systems.

Brian then discussed the methodology he used for simulating animal navigation in the lab. He also discussed the parameters, such as position, orientation, etc., used to model the animals' navigation. He discussed the strategy for understanding the animal’s navigation and replicating the process artificially.

Brian discussed the two kinds of robots used — tethered and untethered — and how they are used in the study. He also shared some open-ended questions researchers are working on in the field.
