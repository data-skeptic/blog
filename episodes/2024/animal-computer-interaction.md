# Animal Computer Interaction

In this episode, we are joined by Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas, an Assistant Professor at the University of Glasgowâ€™s Computer Science Department. She also runs the Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) research group. She joins us to discuss her research on developing technological interfaces for parrots and dogs. 

Ilyena begins by discussing what ACI is. She discussed how researchers in ACI get feedback from their technologies. She gave examples of animals' needs, prompting the need for ACI-driven solutions. 

Ilyena discussed how she designed a technology that allowed parrots to communicate virtually over a video call or through a video recording. She discussed the process of creating the technology interface. She revealed some interesting findings from that research, including factors that affect how the parrots use the technology. 

She shared additional work needed to roll out the technology to the public. She also shared how she and her team measured the parrot's behaviors.

Ilyena also discussed her other research, which allows dogs to interact online. She shared future research directions for her.
