# Weird Communication

Ignacio Escalante Meza, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, joins us in this episode. His research focuses on animal behavior and biomechanics. He mainly studies arachnids such as harvestmen, Treehoppers, etc. He joins us to discuss the communication mechanism of these animals.

Ignacio gave an overview of a harvestman and the research around understanding their behavior. He discussed how understanding biomechanics can help the field of robotics and bioinspired design. Ignacio discussed the benefits of studying the animalsâ€™ behavior in the field compared to simulating them in the lab. 

He then talked about Treehoppers and how they interact with their environment. He discussed how the animals respond to stimuli across a wide range of complexity. He then discussed how researchers gather data to create experiments that study treehopper behaviors. Ignacio spoke about the debate on whether these animals learn how to communicate or whether their communication ability is innate. He also talked about the symbiotic relationship between treehoppers and ants. 

Rounding up, Ignacio shared his plans for the future, including starting up his lab and working with students and other researchers in the field.
