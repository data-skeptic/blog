# Graph Bugs

In this episode today’s guest is Celine Wüst, a master’s student at ETH Zurich specializing in secure and reliable systems, shares her work on automated software testing for graph databases. Celine shows how fuzzing—the process of automatically generating complex queries—helps uncover hidden bugs in graph database management systems like Neo4j, FalconDB, and Apache AGE.

Key insights include how state-aware query generation can detect critical issues like buffer overflows and crashes, the challenges of debugging complex database behaviors, and the importance of security-focused software testing.

We'll also find out which Graph DB company offers swag for finding bugs in its software and get Celine's advice about which graph DB to use.
