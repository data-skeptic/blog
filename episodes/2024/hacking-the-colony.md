# Hacking the Colony

We are joined by Antonio Lopez and Ashay Aswale, PhD students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. They work in the Novel Engineering for Swarm Technologies (NEST) lab. They discussed how ant colonies can be hacked and how to limit this occurrence.

They discussed what Swarm robotics is and its current application. They also discussed the benefits of Swarm robots compared to traditional single robots. 

They shared how ants communicate using stigmergy â€” a process where they leave pheromone trails. They discussed how some ants, called detractors, may leave fake pheromone trails, thereby deceiving the colony.

They discussed how they modeled and simulated the process of the ants foraging, as well as the observations made from their simulation. They shared a potential solution to the fragile pheromone trails. They discussed the future of the field.
