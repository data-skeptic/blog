# Customizing a graph solution

In this episode, Dave Bechberger, principal Graph Architect at AWS and author of "Graph Databases in Action", brings deep insights into the field of graph databases and their applications.

Together we delve into specific scenarios in which Graph Databases provide unique solutions, such as in the fraud industry, and learn how to optimize our DB for questions around connections, such as "How are these entities related?" or "What patterns of interaction indicate anomalies?" 

This discussion sheds light on when organizations should consider adopting graph databases, particularly for cases that require scalable analysis of highly interconnected data and provides practical insights into leveraging graph databases for performance improvements in tasks that traditional relational databases struggle with.
