# Graph Transformations

In this episode, Adam Machowczyk, a PhD student at the University of Leicester, specializes in graph rewriting and its intersection with machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks. 

Adam explains how graph rewriting provides a formalized method to modify graphs using rule-based transformations, allowing for tasks like graph completion, attribute prediction, and structural evolution.

Bridging the worlds of graph rewriting and machine learning, Adam's work aspire to  open new possibilities for creating adaptive, scalable models capable of solving challenges that traditional methods struggle with, such as handling heterogeneous graphs or incorporating incremental updates efficiently.

Real-life applications discussed include using graph transformations to improve recommender systems in social networks, molecular research in chemistry, and enhancing IoT network analysis.
