# Graph Databases and AI

In this episode, we sit down with Yuanyuan Tian, a principal scientist manager at Microsoft Gray Systems Lab, to discuss the evolving role of graph databases in various industries. From her early research on graph queries to her work integrating graph technology into Azure Data Services, she explains how graph databases provide an intuitive way to model relationships between entities, making them suited for complex use cases like fraud detection in finance and insurance, security, healthcare, and supply chain optimization. 

We also discuss the challenges of transitioning from SQL to graph by surveying the broad range of graph DBs in today's market, each with its own capabilities, strengths and weaknesses, pointing to another challenge: the large variance in graph DB languages and how does the industry plan to solve it (spoiler: GQL).

Lastly, we discuss how graphs can enhance LLMs and vice versa - how can LLMs help to create knowledge graphs.
