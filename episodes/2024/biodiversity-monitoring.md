# Biodiversity Monitoring

Hager Hadi, a senior applied scientist at Mila, joins us on this episode. She discussed her paper, [Predicting species occurrence patterns from partial observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18028).

She highlighted the significance of biodiversity monitoring, emphasizing its role in preserving our ecosystem. She discussed the data used in her research and the specific scrapped parameters. She explained why satellite imagery was also important.

She discussed how she cleaned the diverse raw data into a clean distribution of biodiversity. Hager shared how she and her colleagues built a Regression Transformer (R-Tran) model for predicting species occurrence patterns with partial data.

She mentioned the machine learning algorithms that were most useful in building this model. She also discussed the metric for evaluating her model performance. She mentioned potential strategies to improve the performance of her model further. 

Hager mentioned the drawback of interoperability in her model. She shared the usefulness of the model to ecologists and government officials.
