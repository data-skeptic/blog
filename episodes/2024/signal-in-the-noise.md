# Signal in the Noise

In this episode, we are joined by Barbara Webb and Anna Hadjitofi. Barbara runs the Insect Robotics lab at the University of Edinburgh, and Anna is a PhD student at the School of Informatics at the university. She is interested in studying and understanding the neural mechanism of the honeybee waggle dance. They join us to discuss the paper: [Dynamic antennal positioning allows honeybee followers to decode the dance](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(24)00220-3).

Barbara and Anna shared some breakthroughs in the field of animal communication. Anna discussed how the honeybee uses the waggle dance to communicate. She discussed how the colony of bees shares responsibilities when foraging for different food options. Anna also gave some history about the study of the waggle dance.

Our guests explained how they captured the waggle dance of honeybees in their hives. They also discussed how they analyze the data to make conclusive findings. They shared the models used to predict the angle of the dance and also discussed how the honeybee follower understands the angle of the dancer. 

Barbara discussed what the neural socket is. She also discussed how researchers use the neural socket to understand the workings of insects' brains. They both discussed the kind of computations the honeybee brain can do. Rounding up, they shared prospects about bioinspired robotics.
