# Process mining with LLMs

We are joined by David Obembe, a recent graduate of Innovation and Technology Management from the University of Tartu. He joins to discuss his Masters thesis, titled: [Conversational interface for process mining tools using LLMs](https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/home/files/Obembe_Masters_ITM_2024.pdf?study=ATILoputoo&reference=8FD6411E4B89D409180CB5D140C5AB8FF59CA278).

He discussed the objectives of the project and why it was useful. He explained what process mining is and discussed how organizations get event logs to get started with process mining. He also discussed the process of converting an event log to process maps. He explained what the nodes and edges are in a process map.He also explained how to identify bottlenecks, reworks, and other sources of waste in the process.

He then discussed the opportunities LLMs provide to process mining tools to improve the time-to-value for users. He discussed the experiments he conducted to evaluate how well LLMs can answer process mining questions. He also discussed the metrics for evaluating the LLMs. The metrics used were precision, recall and accuracy. He shared the results from his experiments and some insightful takeaways from the results.

He talked about the future approach to improving LLMs performance in answering process mining questions, particularly using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
