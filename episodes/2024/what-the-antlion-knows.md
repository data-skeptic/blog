# What the Antlion Knows

Our guest is Becky Hansis-O’Neil, a Ph.D. student at the University of Missouri, St Louis. Becky has a background on how she got into the field of behavioral intelligence and biology. 

She gave a background into the study of animal behavior and introduced the terms that would become useful in the conversation. She explained how bees' activities can be observed and how to narrow down the variables to consider in studying the behavior of the bees. In this episode, we focus on the antlions' behavior based on the paper: [Operant conditioning in antlion larvae and its impairment following exposure to elevated temperatures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34689302/).

Becky discussed how they designed an experiment using a T-maze to understand antlions' behavior. She discussed the experimental setup and the environmental variables that were changed. She also discussed how the researchers accounted for bias.

Becky discussed some interesting findings from the experiment. She discussed the impact of vibrational cues and temperature increase on ant lions' learning, mortality, and memory. She also explained the reasons for the observations. 

Becky gave her thoughts on the findings of the paper and the methodologies used.
