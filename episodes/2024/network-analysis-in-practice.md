# Network analysis in practice

We are joined by Asaf Shapira, a network analysis consultant and the podcaster of NETfrix – the network science podcast. A network analysis consultant applies Network Science and SNA (Social Network Analysis) to analyze the structure of networks and come up with interesting and relevant insights. Sometimes the network is hidden in the data and the analyst needs to uncover it by modelling the data as a network. 

We discuss the origins of network science and its major discovery that real-world networks follow universal or physical laws that govern their structure and development and how to apply these laws to analyze networks. We also mention and explain algorithms such as PageRank or Community Detection and their how and when to use them.

Asaf shows real use cases that benefited (or could potentially benefit) from network analysis, like contact tracing during Covid19, monitoring social media for inauthentic malicious activity or helping candidates during elections (in a good way).

We delve into ONA (Organizational Network Analysis) and how looking  at organizations through the network lens can help us understand how organizations really work – "who runs the show" and if there might be a mismatch between its goal and structure. 

Lastly, we talked about the biggest challenge network science faces which is how to make it better known and accessible to the general public.
