# Graphs for HPC and LLMs

We are joined by Maciej Besta, a senior researcher of sparse graph computations and large language models at the Scalable Parallel Computing Lab (SPCL) at ETH Zurich.

In this episode, we explore the cutting-edge intersection of graph theory and high-performance computing (HPC) with our guest, a senior researcher at the Scalable Power Computing Lab. The conversation dives deep into graph computing, which deals with modeling complex systems using nodes and edges, as a tool for a variety of computational challenges. 

Our guest discusses the evolution of graph-based solutions for problems ranging from basic graph traversals to more sophisticated workloads like graph databases and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that can be applied in many domains (like biological networks, social networks, and citation networks). 

This episode will also cover Graphs for LLMs, emphasizing how graph-based models not only optimize performance in traditional HPC settings but also pave the way for innovative designs in generative AI, improving both algorithmic efficiency and accuracy through the concept of "Graph-of-Thoughts" â€“ a way to model reasonings as a graph to LLMs with dependencies as edges. 

Lastly, we'll get a few tips on strategies for better prompting.
