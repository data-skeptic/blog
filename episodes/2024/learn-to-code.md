# Learn to Code

Our guests today are Melia Gehan and John Wilmes. But first, our co-host Becky began the show. She discussed her journey from learning HTML and CSS to learning Python and R. She also shared applications of these languages for people in academia. 

Becky shared some challenges with the current style of coding classes. She also discussed how students can debug codes with ChatGPT and other LLMs. Wrapping up, she advised beginners on how to get started on their coding journey.

Melia is a member and principal investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. She and her team work on improving crop resilience to climate change. She discussed how programming is used in this field. She also shared the Python packages useful for computer vision in crop cultivation. She introduced PlantCV and why it is unique. She shared how LLMs are applied in the field of plant science. 

Our second guest, John, is a Machine Learning Researcher at Symbolica AI. John shared his journey to coding. He talked about the Lean programming language and its uniqueness as a language of proof. He also mentioned the challenge with Lean and some state-of-the-art tools, such as LeanDojo, that apply LLMs for theorem proving. Rounding up, he shared advice for people who want to get started with software engineering.
