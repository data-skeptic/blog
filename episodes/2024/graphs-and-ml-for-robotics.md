# Graphs and ML for Robotics

We are joined by [Abhishek Paudel](https://abpaudel.com/), a PhD Student at George Mason University with a research focus on robotics, machine learning, and planning under uncertainty, using graph-based methods to enhance robot behavior.

In this episode, we delve into how graph theory is applied in the field of robotics, based on the paper our guest authored: "Room Classification on Floor Plan Graphs using Graph Neural Networks" which classified rooms in around 143,000 houses and apartments in Japan.

Our guest shares his insights on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for complex spatial tasks, such as room classification and path planning in indoor environments. He explains how graph-based approaches can model environments, capture spatial relationships, and provide a framework for integrating multiple levels of planning and decision-making.
