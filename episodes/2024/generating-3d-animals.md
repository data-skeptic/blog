# Generating 3D Animals

On todayâ€™s episode, we are joined by two guests. Our first guest is Sandeep Mishra, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin. His research is on focus image and video quality assessment. 

Sandeep discussed how the quality of images can be quantitatively measured. He shared how images/videos lose quality and the two methods for predicting the loss. He also discussed the opportunities that exist in this field and generative AI. He discussed how generative models of 3D videos can be made from 2D generative images. 

Sandeep also discussed how he and his co-authors developed a generative model for 3D videos of animal poses despite the small dataset in the field. He also discussed how the models predict the quality of the video. Sandeep talked about the practical applications of his work in filmmaking and other industries.

Our second guest is Oindrila Saha, a PhD student at the UMass Amherst Computer Vision Lab. Her research is centered on learning from limited and imperfect data. She gave examples of the kind of data she uses. She discussed the challenge with learning from limited data. She also discussed how 3D pose images are used to create 3D videos. 

Oindrila also discussed how she and her co-authors built a multi-agent LLM to create a 3D pose. This is useful when 3D pose images are not available. She also mentioned some data augmentation techniques used to increase the data size. 

Oindrila discussed other ideas to improve the performance of the models and briefly discussed the work she is doing with insects and fungi.
