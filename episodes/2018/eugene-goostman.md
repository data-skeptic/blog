## Eugene Goostman

<center>
There once was a bot named Eugene<br/>
designed so judges could not tell between<br/>
the chat of a human<br/>
and the chat of a bot but<br/>
Eugene was a simple machine<br/>

In this episode, Kyle shares his perspective on the chatbot Eugene Goostman which (some claim) "passed" the Turing Test.  As a second topic Kyle also does an intro of the Winograd Schema Challenge.
