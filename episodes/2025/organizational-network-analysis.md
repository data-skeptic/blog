# Organizational Network Analysis
In this episode, Gabriel Petrescu, an organizational network analyst, discusses how network science can provide deep insights into organizational structures using OrgXO, a tool that maps companies as networks rather than rigid hierarchies. Listeners will learn how analyzing workplace collaboration networks can reveal hidden influencers, organizational bottlenecks, and engagement levels, offering a data-driven approach to improving effectiveness and resilience.

Key insights include how companies can identify overburdened employees, address silos between departments, and detect vulnerabilities where too few individuals hold critical knowledge. Real-life applications range from mergers and acquisitions, where network analysis helps assess company dynamics before an acquisition, to restructuring efforts that improve workflow and team collaboration.

Gabrielâ€™s work highlights how organizations can shift from traditional hierarchical thinking to a network-based perspective, leading to smarter decision-making and more adaptable companies.
