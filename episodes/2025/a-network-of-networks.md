# A Network of Networks
In this episode, Bnaya Gross, a Fulbright postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Complex Network Research at Northwestern University, explores the transformative applications of network science in fields ranging from infrastructure to medicine, by studying the interactions between networks ("a network of networks").

Listeners will learn how interdependent networks provide a framework for understanding cascading failures, such as power outages, and how these insights transfer to physical systems like superconducting materials and biological networks.

Key takeaways include understanding how dependencies between networks can amplify vulnerabilities, applying these principles to create resilient infrastructure systems, and using network medicine to uncover relationships between diseases, potential drug repurposing and the process of aging.
