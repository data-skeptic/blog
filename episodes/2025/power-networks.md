# Power Networks

Our guest, Benjamin Schäfer, an assistant professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, explores how network science and physics intersect in the context of modern energy systems. In this episode, listeners will learn how adding new infrastructure—like transmission lines—to power grids can sometimes reduce overall performance due to a counterintuitive phenomenon known as Braess’s paradox.

Key insights include how energy networks, like traffic systems, are governed by flow dynamics where "improvements" can create unexpected bottlenecks or overloads elsewhere in the system. 

Benjamin shares how his team used cycle flow analysis and experimental modeling to reveal these effects in electricity grids, and how such insights can inform better grid design, predictive maintenance, and emergency response.
