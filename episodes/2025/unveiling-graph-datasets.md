# Unveiling Graph Datasets
Bastian Rieck, a tenured professor of machine learning at the University of Fribourg and head of the AIDOS lab, brings a unique perspective combining pure mathematics, machine learning, and graph theory. 

In this episode, listeners will learn about the challenges of evaluating graph learning methods and datasets through the lens of his work on the "No Metric to Rule Them All" paper, introducing the RINGS framework for assessing how much a graph's structure and node features truly contribute to learning tasks.

Key insights include how many popular graph datasets might be misleading researchers by not requiring genuine graph reasoning, the importance of evaluating datasets under structural perturbations, and why researchers should rethink how datasets are curated and validated and what are the "right" questions we should ask them.
