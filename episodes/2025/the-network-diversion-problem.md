# The Network Diversion problem

In this episode, Professor Pål Grønås Drange from the University of Bergen, introduces the field of Parameterized Complexity - a powerful framework for tackling hard computational problems by focusing on specific structural aspects of the input. This framework allows researchers to solve NP-complete problems more efficiently when certain parameters, like the structure of the graph, are "well-behaved".

At the center of the discussion is the network diversion problem, where the goal isn’t to block all routes between two points in a network, but to force flow - such as traffic, electricity, or data - through a specific path. While this problem appears deceptively similar to the classic "Min.Cut/Max.Flow" algorithm, it turns out to be much harder and, in general, its complexity is still unknown. Parameterized complexity plays a key role here by offering ways to make the problem tractable under constraints like low treewidth or planarity, which often exist in real-world networks like road systems or utility grids.

Listeners will learn how vulnerability measures help identify weak points in networks, such as geopolitical infrastructure (e.g., gas pipelines like Nord Stream).
