# Github Network Analysis
In this episode we'll discuss how to use Github data as a network to extract insights about teamwork.

Our guest, Gabriel Ramirez, manager of the notifications team at GitHub, will show how to apply network analysis to better understand and improve collaboration within his engineering team by analyzing GitHub metadata - such as pull requests, issues, and discussions - as a bipartite graph of people and projects.

Some insights we'll discuss are how network centrality measures (like eigenvector and betweenness centrality) reveal organizational dynamics, how vacation patterns influence team connectivity, and how decentralizing communication hubs can foster healthier collaboration. 

Gabriel’s open-source project, GH Graph Explorer, enables other managers and engineers to extract, visualize, and analyze their own GitHub activity using tools like Python, Neo4j, Gephi and LLMs for insight generation, but always remember – don't take the results on face value. Instead, use the results to guide your qualitative investigation.
