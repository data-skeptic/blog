# Auditing LLMs and Twitter

Our guests, Erwan Le Merrer and Gilles Tredan, are long-time collaborators in graph theory and distributed systems. They share their expertise on applying graph-based approaches to understanding both large language model (LLM) hallucinations and shadow banning on social media platforms.

In this episode, listeners will learn how graph structures and metrics can reveal patterns in algorithmic behavior and platform moderation practices.

Key insights include the use of graph theory to evaluate LLM outputs, uncovering patterns in hallucinated graphs that might hint at the underlying structure and training data of the models, and applying epidemic models to analyze the uneven spread of shadow banning on Twitter.
