## Restarting the Newsletter

**td;dr** - If you're signed up, you'll be hearing from us weekly going forward about recent releases.

We let our mailing list go dark a while back for a number of reasons.  Primarily, it was a cost issue.  Our mailing list had grown to the point where the mailchimp bill was over $100 a month.  As a small, independent company that grew out of a hobby project, there are times when bills like this simply need to be trimmed.

Part of my motivation to go silent on our email newsletter was personal experience.  I've signed up for a lot of promising email lists over the years.  Some even start out with great content before relaxing into a mediocre stream of uninspiring headlines that are quite duplicative across the various lists.  I didn't want to send a newsletter that I myself wouldn't want to open and read.  Thus, I sent nothing.

Since starting Data Skeptic, my focus has always been on producing the best weekly interview I can deliver.  When I have extra time, I've invested all of it on doing more research rather than attempts at viral marketing or generating additional revenue.  While that might be laudable from some artistic perspective, it meant that the momentum of Data Skeptic slowed at one point because of my singular vision.  I'm working now to change that.

We had a mailing list so large, I couldn't afford to keep a premium email service.  Rather than seeing that as an opportunity, I saw it as a burden.  Since then, the backend automation software that runs Data Skeptic has become much more sophisticated.  By self-hosting our list and automating several steps in the production process, we've found a way to bring you a weekly newsletter that will have these features every release:

* Contains an original piece of content, typically some behind-the-scenes look into Data Skeptic the podcast and the SaaS Solution Provider
* Let's you know a quick detail about the latest episode
* Suggests a related episode from the archive
* Will be short and sweet and always worth a quick glance if not a click

I hope you stick around.  If not, the newsletters will have an unsubscribe link.

Feedback warmly welcome!

All the best,

Kyle
