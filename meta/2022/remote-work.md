## Data Skeptic: Remote Work

Remote work has historical roots but saw an order of magnitude increase as a result of the pandemic.  Two years later, in-person work has resumed for many, but a major and perhaps permanent shift has occurred in our economy.  Certainly, enough time has now passed that we have data that can tell the true story of the way in which work and employment have changed.

Today, knowledge workers can live with ubiquitous internet.  Skills like computer programming, graphic design, writing, podcasting, and others transition gracefully to a remote working arrangement.  Other professions still struggle to provide equivalent service in a remote setting.

This is a topic that has impacted everyone, and many people have big opinions on the pros and cons of this transition.  What does the data say?  Are we happier / less happy?  Are we more / less productive?  How is collaboration changing?

In this season of Data Skeptic, we'll be exploring questions like these.  The pandemic was a change point.  A long enough time series now exists to explore it in the context of remote work and we look forward to bringing interviews with thought leaders in this area to our listeners.
