## Tone and Content

As a podcast, Data Skeptic is known for cutting away the fluff and focusing dicussions on the aspects of research and data science that are impactful in practice.  Our episodes are relatively short compared to other shows, but backed with content from original, insightful sources.  Our content focuses on key insights for people interested in methodology, engineering, and analysis.

We want to capture the same virtues in our blog posts by writing concise, original, interesting content that leaves the reader satisfied that they invested their time reading our posts.  Every article should have at least one useful takeaway or recommendation.

## Post Types

Our blog focuses on writing articles that fit one of a few templates.  For example, of "Career Profile" is an article telling the story of one professional's career.  Each article will be unique in it's own way, yet hit common key points and questions following the template outline below.

### Career Profile

Regardless of where someone is on their professional journey, the path ahead of them is rarely clear.  Hearing the stories of experienced professionals who have already achieved what readers seek to achieve.  Our career profiles contain the narrative of one individual's professional life from it's starting point to where they are today.

The Career Profile is **not** an opportunity to segway into an unrelated story about the subject's recent vacation, adorable puppy, or unrelated hobby.  If personal elements have an important overlap with their story (e.g. a hobby that became part of their career, an insight found on a trip) it may be a good inclusion.  Otherwise leave personal trivia out and focus on their professional accomplishments.

Career Profiles are written by our blog contributors in collaboration with the individual the post will feature.  You should find a time to chat either via phone or virtual meeting to get aquainted and correspond via email as the article develops.

Below is a list of recommended questions that you should consider asking your interviewee.

* What is your educational background?
* What was your original planned career path?  Does it differ from your actual career path?
* What's the first major break that gets your career going?
* What was the biggest struggle in your career?
* With the benefit of hindsight, what do you wish you had learned or done sooner?
* How has your profession changed since you first took an interest in it?

### Company Profile

A Company Profile should come in 3 parts:

1) The company's products or services
2) Their history or founding story
3) Their current mission

First introduce readers to a company by explaining what value the company provides its customers.  Describe the products or services that they offer.  How do their customers get a benefit?  Next, explore the history (for established companies) or find novel aspects of the founding of the company that contribute to the overall narrative you want to tell.  Lastly, establish what the company is working on currently and what they plan to achieve in the near future.


## Writing Checklist

Articles should meet most of the following qualifications:

* **Strong opening sentence** - Pay special attention to your first sentence.  How do you think it will appear when shared on social media?  Does it entice the reader to read more?  Does it accurate represent the content of the article?

* **Skim Ready** - People's attention spans are short.  Many people may skim your article by reading only the first sentence in each paragraph.  Try reading your article this way and make sure it still leads the reader to a useful summary of your key points.

* **Have a clear insight** - Every article should have at least one tangible bit of "wisdom" or insight.

* **Natural Conclusion**.  Your final paragraph should not end with a cliche such as "In conclusion" or "In summary".  Carefully craft a strong final paragraph that revisits the important points of your article and reminds the reader of any key take-aways or insights they should remember.

* **Eliminate fluff content** - Readers want fast insights.  Their time is valuable.  Don't waste it by padding your content with unnecessary filler text.  When you review your text, consider what can be eliminated or how each sentence could be compressed.

**Bad**

> In machine learning, supervised learning is a type of learning in which the algorithm is provided with data in which eaceh element has a label attached to it.  On the other hand, in contrast to supervised learning, there is also unsupervised learning.  In unsupervised learning, most researchers will agree, the problem is more difficult.  In this situation, no labels are provided.

**Good**

> Machine learning is typically categorized as supervised or unsupervised.  The primary distinction is whether the training data includes labels (supervised) or labels are not available (unsupervised).
