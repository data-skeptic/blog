We're hosting a Live Q&A this Wednesday, June 9th at 4pm PT.

To join, visit [https://riverside.fm/studio/data-skeptic-qa](https://riverside.fm/studio/data-skeptic-qa) at that time.  This is a "guest" link which places you in audience mode.

I plan to talk about some of the things coming up this season on Data Skeptic: Time Series and take questions from the audience.

Hope to see you there!
