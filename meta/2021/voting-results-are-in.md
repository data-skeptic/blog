## Voting Results Are In

Greetings Data Skeptic listener!

Did you vote in our poll to select the next topic that Data Skeptic will focus on?  If so, thank you!  The winner is in.  Our next season will be...

**Data Skeptic: Time Series**

I'm very excited by the choice and am busy at work with our schedule for the next few months.  Time series gives us the opportunity to talk about a variety of methodologies and use cases.  I just finished recording our first interview which I was really lucky to have coordinate with [Rob J Hyndman](https://twitter.com/robjhyndma).  Amongst his accolades is being the author of the free and open source textbook [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) which is an excellent companion for serious listeners that want to get their hands dirty with the subjects we cover.

We're going to be adding a trying out a new segment this season.  It's called "Orders of Magnitude".  It's a short game-show style segment in which I challenge special guests to identify truth from fiction when I present 4 statistics: 1 correct and 3 that are at least one order of magnitude off from the correct value.

I'm really excited with the places we can explore this season on Data Skeptic and hope you enjoy it as well.  Time series allows the perfect combination of methodology topics and use cases that I enjoy covering on the show.

PS - The new theme song is one of the best so far, IMO.  Second to #5, of course.  I hope you like the new one!
