# Welcome to Data Skeptic

Thank you for coming on the Data Skeptic podcast! We appreciate your time and strive to make our interviews as low-stress as possible. We use [Riverside](https://riverside.fm/) virtual studio software to locally record podcast audio. Prior to your interview, you will be provided a link to join our virtual studio via your web browser. We only record audio, but use webcams during the interview to facilitate conversation. Riverside supports [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) web browsers and has standalone apps for [IoS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/riverside-record-podcasts/id1554443872) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=riverside.fm&pli=1). Other web browsers or uncommon operating systems may cause issues during the recording session. 

The best sound quality comes from using a standalone microphone with headphones. However, your onboard microphone will work just fine! To improve sound quality, choose a quiet room with carpet, curtains, and other sound absorbing surfaces. Limit foot traffic into the room where you are interviewing. If this is not possible, that’s totally fine! We understand that not everyone has access to an ideal recording space. 

If you are part of a group interview with your colleagues, make sure each person logs on to Riverside using their own device in separate rooms.
