## Data Skeptic T-Shirt Sizing

We've gotten some questions about the manufacturing and sizing of our t-shirts.  I wanted to post a few details for anyone with questions.

As of the writing of this post, we print on Gildan 64000 Unisex Softstyle T-Shirts.  This is something we may change as inventory and pricing shift.  If we change it, the new base will be something similar.  If the brand of the t-shirt is important to you, please email first.

What is probably more important to everyone is SIZING!  Below are our specifications.  In support of [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units), we list units first in centimeters, followed by inches.

### Metric
