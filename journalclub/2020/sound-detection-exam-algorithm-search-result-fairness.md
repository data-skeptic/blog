# Sound Detection, Exam Algorithm, and Search Result Fairness

We have a new guest this week! Rachel Bittner, a research scientist at Spotify, joins us in our discussion. She brings us the paper "[Few-Shot Sound Event Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054708)." Lan discusses an article about fairness of search results, "[Algorithm Improves Fairness of Search Results](https://techxplore.com/news/2020-08-algorithm-fairness-results.html)." George talks about a blog post from England about an algorithm grading exams and the controversy around it, "[A-levels and GCSEs: How Did the Exam Algorithm Work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53807730)." Last but not least, Kyle brings us an article titled "[Eye-Catching Advances in Some AI Fields are not Real](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/eye-catching-advances-some-ai-fields-are-not-real)."
